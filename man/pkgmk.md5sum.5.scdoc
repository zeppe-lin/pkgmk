PKGMK.MD5SUM(5)

# NAME

pkgmk.md5sum - MD5 checksum file for source verification

# SYNOPSIS

*.md5sum*

# DESCRIPTION

The _.md5sum_ file is used by *pkgmk*(8) to verify the integrity of
downloaded source files.
It contains the MD5 checksums for each file listed in the *source*
variable of the _Pkgfile_.

During a build, *pkgmk*(8) recalculates checksums and compares them
against this file.
If mismatches are found, *pkgmk*(8) reports the differences and exits
with an error.
If the file is missing and checking is enabled, *pkgmk*(8) warns and
generates a new one.

# FILE FORMAT

The file is a plain text, one entry per line, in the format:

```
checksum  filename
```

*checksum*
	A 32-character lowercase hexadecimal string representing the
	MD5 digest of the file.
*filename*
	Usually the basename of the source file as listed in the
	*source* variable of the _Pkgfile_.

Lines beginning with a hash ('*#*') and empty lines are ignored.
Entries are usually sorted by filename.

The format is identical to the output of *md5sum*(1).

Checksum verification and file creation may be controlled by
*pkgmk*(8) options; see *pkgmk*(8) for details.

# FILES

_.md5sum_
	MD5 checksums of package source files.
	Located in the package source directory alongside the
