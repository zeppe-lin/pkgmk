# DESCRIPTION

The *pkgmk* utility builds software into a package archive suitable
for installation with *pkgadd*(8).
Each build is controlled by a _Pkgfile_ in the current directory,
which defines sources and the build procedure.

*pkgmk* downloads missing sources, verifies integrity, extracts them
into a working directory, and executes the build instructions.
A package is rebuilt only when its sources or the _Pkgfile_ have
changed, unless *-f* is specified.

Options override defaults in *pkgmk.conf*(5).

## General options

*-cf* _config-file_, *--config-file*=_config-file_
	Use an alternate configuration file.

	Default: _/etc/pkgmk.conf_.

*-h*, *--help*
	Print usage and exit.

*-v*, *--version*
	Print version and exit.

## One-shot actions

The following options perform a single task and then exit.
They cannot be combined with build modifiers unless noted.

*-c*, *--clean*
	Remove built package and downloaded sources, then exit.

*-cm*, *--check-md5sum*
	Verify source checksums against _.md5sum_, then exit.

	May be combined with *-d*.

*-do*, *--download-only*
	Download missing sources only, then exit.

*-eo*, *--extract-only*
	Download and extract sources into the working directory, then
	exit.

*-uf*, *--update-footprint*
	Update _.footprint_ with the file list from the last built
	package, then exit.

	Use this to accept the previous build when a footprint check
	has failed.

*-um*, *--update-md5sum*
	Regenerate _.md5sum_ from the current sources, then exit.

	May be combined with *-d*.

*-utd*, *--up-to-date*
	Check if the package is up to date, then exit.

## Build modifiers

These options alter how a normal build proceeds.
They may be freely combined.

*-af* _archive-format_, *--archive-format*=_archive-format_
	Use an alternate package archive format.

	Supported formats:

	gnutar
		GNU tar format.
	pax
		POSIX 1003.1-2001 (pax) format.
	ustar
		POSIX 1003.1-1988 (ustar) format.
	v7
		Old V7 tar format.

	See *packages*(7) and *libarchive-formats*(5).

	Default: gnutar.

*-d*, *--download*
	Download missing source files before building.

*-f*, *--force*
	Rebuild even if the package is already up to date.

*-if*, *--ignore-footprint*
	Build without performing a footprint check.

*-im*, *--ignore-md5sum*
	Build without verifying source checksums.

*-in*, *--ignore-new*
	Proceed with build, ignoring new files reported during a
	footprint mismatch.

*-kw*, *--keep-work*
	Keep the temporary working directory after the build
	completes.

*-ns*, *--no-strip*
	Do not strip binaries or libraries.

# FILES

_/etc/pkgmk.conf_
	Default configuration file.

	See *pkgmk.conf*(5).

_Pkgfile_
	Build script describing a package.

	See *pkgmk.Pkgfile*(5).

_.md5sum_
	Checksums of source files.

	See *pkgmk.md5sum*(5).

_.footprint_
	Manifest of files included in a built package.

	See *pkgmk.footprint*(5).

_.nostrip_
	Patterns for files excluded from stripping.

	See *pkgmk.nostrip*(5).

_.32bit_
	Flag for enabling 32-bit build mode.

	See *pkgmk.32bit*(5).

# EXIT STATUS

The *pkgmk* utility exits with one of the following values:

*0*
	Success.
*1*
	General error.
*2*
	Invalid _Pkgfile_ (missing required variables or functions).
*3*
	Missing directory or permission error
	(source/build directories).
*4*
	Failed to download sources.
*5*
	Failed to unpack sources.
*6*
	MD5 checksum verification failed.
*7*
	Footprint check failed.
*8*
	Error during execution of the *build()* function.
*130*

; # HISTORY
; 
; The *pkgmk* utility first appeared in CRUX Linux and has been

# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

*pkgmk* must *not* be run as the real superuser.
Builds should be performed under *fakeroot*(8) or an equivalent
environment.
Running as root risks allowing untrusted build scripts to alter system
files.

Always confine builds to a dedicated user and controlled working
directory.
