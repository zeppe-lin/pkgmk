ABOUT
-----

makes a software package.

This *pkgmk* distribution is a fork of CRUX' *pkgmk* utility (which is
part of CRUX' *pkgutils* software) as of commit 9ca0da6
(Sat Nov 17 2018) with the following differences:
- it was rewritten in POSIX sh(1p)
- added support of suckless' sbase utilities
- added support of aria2c(1) downloader
- the man pages have been rewritten in POD
- added Pkgfile(5) man page
- added bash completion
- removed "-i", "-u", and "-r" command-line options

  distributed through git(1) with signed commits
