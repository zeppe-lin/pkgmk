This directory contains pkgmk, a package management utility, which
makes a software package.

It is a fork of CRUX' pkgmk utility (extracted from pkgutils sources).
It was rewritten in POSIX shell, added support of aria2 downloader,
and hardly adjusted from zeppe-lin distribution.  The original sources
can be downloaded from:

  1. https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=tools/pkgutils.git;a=summary
  2. git://crux.nu/tools/pkgutils.git

The actual dependencies are: make(1p) and pod2man(1pm).  For
downloading the sources pkgmk needs one of the following: aria2,
curl, wget.  In the runtime pkgmk uses sh(1) and bsdtar(1), and POSIX
utilities.
